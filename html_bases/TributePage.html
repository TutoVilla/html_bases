            <li>Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving 
                a degree, gaining practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in 
                the new electric power industry. In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized 
                citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his 
                own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in 
                New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction 
                motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable 
                amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.</li>
                <br>
                <br>
            <li>Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with 
                mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a
                 wireless-controlled boat, one of the first-ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and 
                 demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his 
                 showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting 
                 and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments
                  in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless
                   communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished
                    Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but
                     ran out of funding before he could complete it.</li>
                <br>
                <br>
            <li>After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with 
                varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York 
                hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 1943. Tesla's work 
                fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the General Conference on 
                Weights and Measures named the SI unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor. There
                 has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.</li>
